# fcntl-tool

Your small yet useful swiss army knife for the `fcntl` system call,
specifically for acquiring and testing file locks, but not limited to those.

This tool only works on UNIX or POSIX-like systems. Please find more
information in the following resources:

- <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>
- <https://apenwarr.ca/log/20101213>

## üîç What Problem Does It Solve?

This is for example useful for testing during development. Imagine you want
to check how your program behaves, when a lock is already held. Using
`fcntl-tool`, you can acquire these locks!

## Supported Platforms

This crate works on all platforms that Rust code can be compiled to. It,
however, only makes sense on UNIX or POSIX-like systems.

## Supported `fcntl` Operations

| operation     | supported |
|---------------|-----------|
| `F_GETLK`     | ‚úÖ         |
| `F_SETLK`     | ‚úÖ         |
| `F_OFD_GETLK` | ‚úÖ         |
| `F_OFD_SETLK` | ‚úÖ         |
| ...           | Not yet   |
